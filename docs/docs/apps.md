# Apps Page

The **Apps Page** is a simple app installer that uses **Winget** to install or uninstall applications on your system.

- **Install / Uninstall apps**: Select apps and perform actions with a single click.
- **Installed apps tracking**: Shows which apps are already installed.
- **Search and categories**: Quickly find apps by name or category.
- **Custom contributions**: Add new apps to the installer by editing the `apps.json` file in `src/renderer/assets` and make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/parcoil/sparkle).
